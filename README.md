# Nepali Sign Language Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing Nepali sign language gestures using advanced deep learning techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **YOLO**

## Project Overview
1. **Data Collection and Annotation**
   - Collected and annotated a dataset of Nepali Sign Language images.

2. **Model Development**
   - Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Nepali sign language gestures.
   - Utilized Keras Functional API for transfer learning, fine-tuning EfficientNet and MobileNetV3 models.

3. **Object Detection**
   - Implemented YOLOv8 for object detection, enhancing the model's capability to recognize Nepali sign language in real-time.
